    <!--  Your attention to detail is commendable. It's evident that you've invested time and effort into honing your coding skills. 
Keep up the phenomenal work, and I have no doubt that you'll continue to thrive as a talented coder. Well done Mr AYðŸš€ðŸš€! 
  
However, I noticed in the gender section, you gave all the gender input elements, the same id of gender, this is wrong sir,
reason is, id are meant to be specific, only one element can have a specific id. Although your code did not error out, it is still wrong.

What you can do is give the male input element and id of male, female input element an id of female, and others others. If you are not sure of what I mean,
I will talk about this in class tomorrow.

Wellodne again Mr AY, you are doing great-->
